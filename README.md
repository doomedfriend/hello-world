# hello-world
Basic repo for self 

Hi I am Bob or doomedfriend. I am learning software development and coding to get a second bachelor's degree so that I can work in the software development field. I already have a psychology degree which I loved getting. Currently, my most familiar language is C, but I am learning Ruby for the software dev class I am currently in, and I plan on learning Python and C++ and C# in the future. I also plan on making my own video game under the company name of DoomNet (wip name). I also plan on using this name or something similar for other development projects (or more realistically just my name).
